abstract: Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) is a nonlinear spectroscopy technique capable of identifying whether apparent continua in linear response are made out of multiplets of sharp deconfined quasiparticles. This makes it a potent tool for experimental identification of fractionalized phases. Previous discussions have focused on limits where the quasiparticles in question are infinitely long lived. In this paper we discuss 2DCS in the regime where the fractionalized quasiparticles can themselves decay. We introduce a powerful path-integral-based approach, whereby the computation of nonlinear susceptibilities reduces to an efficient exercise in diagrammatic perturbation theory. We apply this method to compute the 2DCS response of the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, in the presence of integrability-breaking perturbations. We discuss aspects of the self-energy of the fractionalized quasiparticles that may be extracted via 2DCS, such as the momentum-dependent decay rate.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We outline how multidimensional coherent spectroscopy can be used to extract quantitative information about interaction effects in many-body quantum systems.
